    <center><p>"Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani" is an upcoming Bollywood movie directed by Karan Johar. The film marks Johar's return to directing after a hiatus. It's reported to be a romantic drama featuring a stellar cast including Ranveer Singh, Alia Bhatt, Dharmendra, Jaya Bachchan, and Shabana Azmi. The film's title suggests it might be a modern-day take on the classic love story theme, possibly exploring the complexities of relationships against the backdrop of contemporary society. As of my last update, details about the plot and release date might not be fully confirmed, so it's best to keep an eye out for official announcements for more information.</p></center>
