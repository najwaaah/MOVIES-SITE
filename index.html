  <center><p>A movie, also known as a film or motion picture, is a visual art form that uses moving images and sound to tell a story or convey a message. Movies are created by capturing real-life scenes with a camera or through animation techniques, and they can range from short films lasting a few minutes to feature-length films that are typically around 90 minutes to three hours. </p></center>
